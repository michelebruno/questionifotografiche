  "progetto": {
    "articolato": "A reportage deeply structured in different themes and studies on the small and big “landscape”, with ethno-anthropological readings developed through the medium of photography. Suggestions for another dimension and an idea of memory, place, narration, landscape, design and domestic architecture in the time of Coronavirus.",
    "citazione": " “(…) Only the inhabitants provide importance and character to those places to which they refuse to give up (…) They look at them as if they were reading their own hand, knowing that in order to learn something it is critical to do it with an extreme attention. Because, except for the main lines, that are thick and clear, there are many other thin lines that cross each other until they underline the uniqueness of the entire system.”",
    "interessanteriprendere": "It is interesting, moreover, to recount once again the tale of “Voyage autour de ma chambre”. An intriguing story about the thousands of fantasies, and possible journeys, that can be lived without even leaving someone’s own room.",
    "nasce": "The project was born from the idea of creating a journey, an occasion to rediscover, as Xavier De Maistre did in his “Voyage autour de ma chambre”, the infinite memories of the domestic landscape. A scenery full of narratives, as Vittorio Lingiardi alludes in “mindscapes” or Luigi Ghirri shows in “Identikit”.",
    "scopodellequestioni": "The aim of each single <1>questione fotografica</1> is to get in touch with an instrument such as the camera or smartphone, but most importantly to trigger questions about different places and their functions. Learning to listen to the tales (as in projects, emotions, memories and affections) that are waiting to be <2>captured</2>, as Ghirri would describe in his speech “Una luce sul muro” in 1993:"
